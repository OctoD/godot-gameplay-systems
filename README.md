Enjoy! 

## How does it work?

You can check some tutorials/doc/examples [here](./docs/readme.md)

I am making also small "demos" to demonstrate how things work. You can check them out opening this repository using godot 4.x (stable), pressing the play button and choosing one.

`Esc` key will always return you to the main menu.

# Networking and multiplayer

Did not test too much, but abilities, effects and attributes could be replicated using the `MultiplayerSynchronizer` node provided by godot4.x.

The same should apply to `Inventory` and `Equipment`.

# Contribution

Every contribution is really welcome, feel free to contribute!

You can open PR, issues or you can suggest features. Have a good day you wonderful Godot people!
